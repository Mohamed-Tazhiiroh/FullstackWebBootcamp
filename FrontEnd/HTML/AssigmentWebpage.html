    <h1>History of Islam</h1>
    <hr>
    <span>From Wikipedia , the free encylopedia</span>

    <i>This article is about the history of Islam as a culture and polity. For a history of the Islamic faith, see <a

    <p>
        <span>The <b>history of Islam</b> concerns the political, social, economic, military, and cultural developments
            of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world">Islamic civilization.</a> Most historians
            <sup>[3]</sup> believe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam">Islam</a> originated in Mecca and
            Medina at the start of the <sup>7th</sup> century CE. <sup>[4]</sup> Muslims regard Islam as a return to the
            original faith of the <a href="">Abrahamic prophets</a> , such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David,
            Solomon, and Jesus,
            with the submission (Islām) to the will of God. <sup>[5][6][7]</sup></span>
        <span>According to the traditional account,[4][8] the Islamic prophet Muhammad began
            receiving what Muslims
            consider to be divine revelations in 610 CE, calling for submission to the one God, the expectation of the
            imminent Last Judgement, and caring for the poor and needy.[6][Note 1] Muhammad's message won over a handful
            of followers (the ṣaḥāba) and was met with increasing opposition from Meccan notables.[6][Note 2] In 622 CE,
            a few years after losing protection with the death of his influential uncle ʾAbū Ṭālib ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib,
            Muhammad migrated to the city of Yathrib (now known as Medina).[6] With the death of Muhammad in 632 CE,
            disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community during the Rāshidūn
            Caliphate. <sup>[4][10][11][12]</sup></span>
        <span>
            By the 8th century CE, the Umayyad Caliphate extended from Muslim Iberia in the west to the Indus River in
            the east. Polities such as those ruled by the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates (in the Middle East and later
            in Spain and Southern Italy), the Fatimids, Seljuks, Ayyubids, and Mamluks were among the most influential
            powers in the world. Highly Persianized empires built by the Samanids, Ghaznavids, and Ghurids significantly
            contributed to technological and administrative developments. The Islamic Golden Age gave rise to many
            centers of culture and science and produced notable polymaths, astronomers, mathematicians, physicians, and
            philosophers during the Middle Ages.

            By the early 13th century, the Delhi Sultanate conquered the northern Indian subcontinent, while Turkic
            dynasties like the Sultanate of Rum and Artuqids conquered much of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire
            throughout the 11th and 12th centuries. In the 13th and 14th centuries, destructive Mongol invasions and
            those of Tamerlane (Timur) from the east, along with the loss of population due to the Black Death, greatly
            weakened the traditional centers of the Muslim world, stretching from Persia to Egypt, but saw the emergence
            of the Timurid Renaissance and major global economic powers such as the Mali Empire in West Africa and the
            Bengal Sultanate in South Asia.[13][14][15] Following the deportation and enslavement of the Muslim Moors
            from the Emirate of Sicily and other Italian territories,[16] the Islamic Iberia was gradually conquered by
            Christian forces during the Reconquista. Nonetheless, in the early modern period, the states of the Age of
            the Islamic Gunpowders—Ottoman Turkey, Mughal India, and Safavid Iran—emerged as world powers.

            During the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the Muslim world fell under the influence or direct
            control of the European Great Powers. Their efforts to win independence and build modern nation-states over
            the course of the last two centuries continue to reverberate to the present day, as well as fuel
            conflict-zones in regions such as Palestine, Kashmir, Xinjiang, Chechnya, Central Africa, Bosnia, and
            Myanmar. The oil boom stabilized the Arab States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, making them the world's
            largest oil producers and exporters, which focus on capitalism, free trade, and tourism.[17][18]

        <p>The following timeline can serve as a rough visual guide to the most important polities in the Islamic world
            prior to the First World War. It covers major historical centers of power and culture, including Arabia,
            Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Persia (modern Iran), Levant (modern Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and
            Israel/Palestine), Egypt, Maghreb (north-west Africa), al-Andalus (Iberia), Transoxania (Central Asia),
            Hindustan (including modern Pakistan, North India and Bangladesh), and Anatolia (modern Turkey). It is
            necessarily an approximation, since rule over some regions was sometimes divided among different centers of
            power, and authority in larger polities was often distributed among several dynasties. For example, during
            the later stages of the Abbasid Caliphate, even the capital city of Baghdad was effectively ruled by other
            dynasties such as the Buyyids and the Seljuks, while the Ottoman Turks commonly delegated executive
            authority over outlying provinces to local potentates, such as the Deys of Algiers, the Beys of Tunis, and
            the Mamluks of Iraq.</p>
